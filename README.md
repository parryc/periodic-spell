Because you've always wanted to know if your name could be spelled using only the table of elements, but using JavaScript, instead of just looking at a periodic table.

### Use ###

What? You're actually going to use this? 

````periodicSpell.check("phrase")```` returns an array of objects with the ````name````,````sym````(bol),````num````(ber),and ````weight```` of the elements used to make the phrase. ````check```` automatically strips spaces. If there's no result, it returns false.
